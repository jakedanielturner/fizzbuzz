# Fizzbuzz project
This project was inspired by the Tom Scott video, available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a Javascript programme, capable of playing the childrens game of Fizzbuzz. Simply, two players count up from zero, in turns. When the number is a multiple of three, the number is replaced with Fizz. When the number is a multiple of five, the number is replaced with Buzz. When the number is a multiple of both, the number is replaced with Fizzbuzz. If the number is a multiple of neither, the number is called out, unchanged.
